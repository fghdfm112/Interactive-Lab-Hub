  [![Watch the video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1128669/135009222-111fe522-e6ba-46ad-b6dc-d1633d21129c.png)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q8FWzLMobx0?start=19)

  In this lab, we want you to design interaction with a speech-enabled device--something that listens and talks to you. This device can do anything *but* control lights (since we already did that in Lab 1).  First, we want you first to storyboard what you imagine the conversational interaction to be like. Then, you will use wizarding techniques to elicit examples of what people might say, ask, or respond.  We then want you to use the examples collected from at least two other people to inform the redesign of the device.

  We will focus on **audio** as the main modality for interaction to start; these general techniques can be extended to **video**, **haptics** or other interactive mechanisms in the second part of the Lab.

  ## Prep for Part 1: Get the Latest Content and Pick up Additional Parts 

  Please check instructions in [prep.md](prep.md) and complete the setup before class on Wednesday, Sept 23rd.

  ### Pick up Web Camera If You Don't Have One

  Students who have not already received a web camera will receive their [Logitech C270 Webcam](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Desktop-Widescreen-Calling-Recording/dp/B004FHO5Y6/ref=sr_1_3?crid=W5QN79TK8JM7&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.FB-davgIQ_ciWNvY6RK4yckjgOCrvOWOGAG4IFaH0fczv-OIDHpR7rVTU8xj1iIbn_Aiowl9xMdeQxceQ6AT0Z8Rr5ZP1RocU6X8QSbkeJ4Zs5TYqa4a3C_cnfhZ7_ViooQU20IWibZqkBroF2Hja2xZXoTqZFI8e5YnF_2C0Bn7vtBGpapOYIGCeQoXqnV81r2HypQNUzFQbGPh7VqjqDbzmUoloFA2-QPLa5lOctA.L5ztl0wO7LqzxrIqDku9f96L9QrzYCMftU_YeTEJpGA&dib_tag=se&keywords=webcam%2Bc270&qid=1758416854&sprefix=webcam%2Bc270%2Caps%2C125&sr=8-3&th=1) and bluetooth speaker on Wednesday at the beginning of lab. If you cannot make it to class this week, please contact the TAs to ensure you get these. 

  ### Get the Latest Content

  As always, pull updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub to both your Pi and your own GitHub repo. There are 2 ways you can do so:

  **\[recommended\]**Option 1: On the Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub`, pull the updates from upstream (class lab-hub) and push the updates back to your own GitHub repo. You will need the *personal access token* for this.

  ```
  pi@ixe00:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub
  pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git pull upstream Fall2025
  pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git add .
  pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git commit -m "get lab3 updates"
  pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git push
  ```

  Option 2: On your your own GitHub repo, [create pull request](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2022Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md) to get updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub. After you have latest updates online, go on your Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub` and use `git pull` to get updates from your own GitHub repo.

  <summary>Instruction</summary>
  ### Setup 

  Activate your virtual environment

  ```
  pi@ixe00:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub
  pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ cd Lab\ 3
  pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 3 $ python3 -m venv .venv
  pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ source .venv/bin/activate
  (.venv)pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ 
  ```

  Run the setup script
  ```(.venv)pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ pip install -r requirements.txt  ```

  Next, run the setup script to install additional text-to-speech dependencies:
  ```
  (.venv)pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 3 $ ./setup.sh
  ```

  ### Text to Speech 

  In this part of lab, we are going to start peeking into the world of audio on your Pi! 

  We will be using the microphone and speaker on your webcamera. In the directory is a folder called `speech-scripts` containing several shell scripts. `cd` to the folder and list out all the files by `ls`:

  ```
  pi@ixe00:~/speech-scripts $ ls
  Download        festival_demo.sh  GoogleTTS_demo.sh  pico2text_demo.sh
  espeak_demo.sh  flite_demo.sh     lookdave.wav
  ```

  You can run these shell files `.sh` by typing `./filename`, for example, typing `./espeak_demo.sh` and see what happens. Take some time to look at each script and see how it works. You can see a script by typing `cat filename`. For instance:

  ```
  pi@ixe00:~/speech-scripts $ cat festival_demo.sh 
  #from: https://elinux.org/RPi_Text_to_Speech_(Speech_Synthesis)#Festival_Text_to_Speech
  ```
  You can test the commands by running
  ```
  echo "Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?" | festival --tts
  ```

  Now, you might wonder what exactly is a `.sh` file? 
  Typically, a `.sh` file is a shell script which you can execute in a terminal. The example files we offer here are for you to figure out the ways to play with audio on your Pi!

  You can also play audio files directly with `aplay filename`. Try typing `aplay lookdave.wav`.
</details>


\*\***Write your own shell file to use your favorite of these TTS engines to have your Pi greet you by name.**\*\*
(This shell file should be saved to your own repo for this lab.)

[This is the shell file](speech-scripts/greetevan.sh)
It could greet me.

  <summary> Bonus </summary>
  ---
  Bonus:
  [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) is another fast neural based text to speech package for raspberry pi which can be installed easily through python with:
  ```
  pip install piper-tts
  ```
  and used from the command line. Running the command below the first time will download the model, concurrent runs will be faster. 
  ```
  echo 'Welcome to the world of speech synthesis!' | piper \
    --model en_US-lessac-medium \
    --output_file welcome.wav
  ```
  Check the file that was created by running `aplay welcome.wav`. Many more languages are supported and audio can be streamed dirctly to an audio output, rather than into an file by:

  ```
  echo 'This sentence is spoken first. This sentence is synthesized while the first sentence is spoken.' | \
    piper --model en_US-lessac-medium --output-raw | \
    aplay -r 22050 -f S16_LE -t raw -
  ```
</details>

### Speech to Text

<details>
   <summary> Speech to Text </summary>
  Next setup speech to text. We are using a speech recognition engine, [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/), which is made by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. Vosk is amazing because it is an offline speech recognition engine; that is, all the processing for the speech recognition is happening onboard the Raspberry Pi. 

  Make sure you're running in your virtual environment with the dependencies already installed:
  ```
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

  Test if vosk works by transcribing text:

  ```
  vosk-transcriber -i recorded_mono.wav -o test.txt
  ```

  You can use vosk with the microphone by running 
  ```
  python test_microphone.py -m en
  ```

  ---
  Bonus:
  [Whisper](https://openai.com/index/whisper/) is a neural network–based speech-to-text (STT) model developed and open-sourced by OpenAI. Compared to Vosk, Whisper generally achieves higher accuracy, particularly on noisy audio and diverse accents. It is available in multiple model sizes; for edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi 5 used in this class, the tiny.en model runs with reasonable latency even without a GPU.

  By contrast, Vosk is more lightweight and optimized for running efficiently on low-power devices like the Raspberry Pi. The choice between Whisper and Vosk depends on your scenario: if you need higher accuracy and can afford slightly more compute, Whisper is preferable; if your priority is minimal resource usage, Vosk may be a better fit.

  In this class, we provide two Whisper options: A quantized 8-bit faster-whisper model for speed, and the standard Whisper model. Try them out and compare the trade-offs.

  Make sure you're in the Lab 3 directory with your virtual environment activated:
  ```
  cd ~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab\ 3/speech-scripts
  source ../.venv/bin/activate
  ```

  Then test the Whisper models:
  ```
  python whisper_try.py
  ```
  and

  ```
  python faster_whisper_try.py
  ```

\*\***Write your own shell file that verbally asks for a numerical based input (such as a phone number, zipcode, number of pets, etc) and records the answer the respondent provides.**\*\*

<br>

[This is the shell file](speech-scripts/havenumber.sh)

<br>

[This is the pythom program I write for the shell](speech-scripts/listen_once.py)

<br>

[This is the output txt file for recorded number](speech-scripts/voice_result.txt)

In my shell file, I created a simple voice interaction system. First, the computer speaks out loud using Festival to ask the user for a number. Then it runs a Python program that listens through the microphone and uses speech recognition to capture what the user says. The spoken answer is saved into a text file called voice_result.txt, which acts like a notebook where the computer records the response. Finally, the computer speaks again to confirm that the answer was successfully recorded. This way, the script combines text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and file saving into one flow that lets the computer ask a question, listen to the reply, and store the result.

### 🤖 NEW: AI-Powered Conversations with Ollama

<details>
   <summary> AI-Powered Conversations with Ollama </summary>

[This is the python file]("ollama/weather.py)


### Serving Pages

<details>
  In Lab 1, we served a webpage with flask. In this lab, you may find it useful to serve a webpage for the controller on a remote device. Here is a simple example of a webserver.

  ```
  pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 3 $ python server.py
  * Serving Flask app "server" (lazy loading)
  * Environment: production
    WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
    Use a production WSGI server instead.
  * Debug mode: on
  * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
  * Restarting with stat
  * Debugger is active!
  * Debugger PIN: 162-573-883
  ```
  From a remote browser on the same network, check to make sure your webserver is working by going to `http://<YourPiIPAddress>:5000`. You should be able to see "Hello World" on the webpage.
</details>

### Storyboard

Storyboard and/or use a Verplank diagram to design a speech-enabled device. (Stuck? Make a device that talks for dogs. If that is too stupid, find an application that is better than that.) 

\*\***Post your storyboard and diagram here.**\*\*

I want to turn my Raspberry Pi into an interactive word-guessing game device. The Pi will randomly select a word and, with the help of Ollama AI, generate descriptive hints for me to guess it. If I guess correctly, the device will congratulate me and ask if I’d like to play again, restarting the game with a new word. If my guess is wrong, it will provide additional descriptions to guide me closer to the answer until I succeed. This creates a fun, replayable, AI-powered guessing game experience directly on the Pi.

![Storyboard](lab3sb.png)

![Verplank diagram](lab3vd.png)


Write out what you imagine the dialogue to be. Use cards, post-its, or whatever method helps you develop alternatives or group responses. 

\*\***Please describe and document your process.**\*\*

*Start:*

Pi: "Welcome to the Word Guessing Game! I’m thinking of a word. Want to play?"
You: "Yes."
Pi: "Great! Here’s your first clue: It’s something that shines in the sky during the day."

*Correct Guess*

You: "The Sun."
Pi: "Correct! Congratulations! Run again if you want to play more."

*Wrong*

You: "A lamp?"
Pi: "Not quite! Here’s another clue: This object cannot fit in your pocket."


### Acting out the dialogue

Find a partner, and *without sharing the script with your partner* try out the dialogue you've designed, where you (as the device designer) act as the device you are designing.  Please record this interaction (for example, using Zoom's record feature).

\*\***Describe if the dialogue seemed different than what you imagined when it was acted out, and how.**\*\*

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dBaWNTfSdA33EF9Ixb4xbGO_IqPZ9_zW/view?usp=sharing


The general idea is the same. The wording is slightly different, could be explained by random in "AI". It seems to work.



### Wizarding with the Pi (optional)
<details>
  In the [demo directory](./demo), you will find an example Wizard of Oz project. In that project, you can see how audio and sensor data is streamed from the Pi to a wizard controller that runs in the browser.  You may use this demo code as a template. By running the `app.py` script, you can see how audio and sensor data (Adafruit MPU-6050 6-DoF Accel and Gyro Sensor) is streamed from the Pi to a wizard controller that runs in the browser `http://<YouPiIPAddress>:5000`. You can control what the system says from the controller as well!
</details>

\*\***Describe if the dialogue seemed different than what you imagined, or when acted out, when it was wizarded, and how.**\*\*

I am unable to run the app even I installed the old python version for the required packages.

# Lab 3 Part 2

For Part 2, you will redesign the interaction with the speech-enabled device using the data collected, as well as feedback from part 1.

## Prep for Part 2

1. What are concrete things that could use improvement in the design of your device? For example: wording, timing, anticipation of misunderstandings...
2. What are other modes of interaction _beyond speech_ that you might also use to clarify how to interact?
3. Make a new storyboard, diagram and/or script based on these reflections.

## Prototype your system

The system should:
* use the Raspberry Pi 
* use one or more sensors
* require participants to speak to it. 

*Document how the system works*

*Include videos or screencaptures of both the system and the controller.*

## Voice-Controlled Word Guessing Game


### Overview

This is an interactive voice-controlled word guessing game that uses AI (Ollama) for word generation and hint creation, combined with speech recognition for voice input. The game is entirely hands-free and uses text-to-speech for feedback.

### How It Works

#### Game Start 🎯
The system welcomes you with speech: "Hi, Welcome to this game. I have randomly selected a word for you to guess."
An AI (Ollama qwen2.5:0.5b-instruct model) generates a random simple word (like animals, objects, or food: cat, apple, book, etc.)

#### Guessing Loop
Your Turn: The system says "You can guess the word now."
Voice Input: You speak your guess, which is captured by the speech recognition system (Vosk)
Checking: Your guess is compared directly to the correct answer

#### Feedback
If Correct: "You guessed the word correctly." - Game ends!
If Wrong :
"That's not correct."
"Here is the hint: [AI-generated hint]"
The hint is a short description (6 words or less) like "furry pet that meows" for "cat"
Loop continues - you get another chance to guess

## Test the system
Try to get at least two people to interact with your system. (Ideally, you would inform them that there is a wizard _after_ the interaction, but we recognize that can be hard.)

Answer the following:

### What worked well about the system and what didn't?
\*\**your answer here*\*\*

The system successfully managed the overall game flow — generating random words, giving spoken instructions through Festival TTS, and responding with appropriate hints or confirmations. Its structure of linking Python logic with a shell loop made the interactions smooth and modular. However, the timing between TTS responses and user input occasionally felt delayed, and the system sometimes repeated prompts if voice recognition lagged or misinterpreted results. Improving synchronization and adding error-handling for unexpected audio input would make it more seamless.

### What worked well about the controller and what didn't?

\*\**your answer here*\*\*

The controller performed well in capturing and transcribing voice input using Vosk and sounddevice. It provided a natural way for users to interact hands-free, enhancing engagement compared to text-based guessing. However, it struggled with background noise and pronunciation variations, occasionally leading to incorrect guesses being sent to the system. Adding noise suppression, input confirmation, or simple keyword feedback could make the controller more reliable and responsive.

### What lessons can you take away from the WoZ interactions for designing a more autonomous version of the system?

\*\**your answer here*\*\*

Future versions should incorporate contextual understanding and more flexible dialogue management so the system feels conversational rather than procedural.

### How could you use your system to create a dataset of interaction? What other sensing modalities would make sense to capture?

\*\**your answer here*\*\*

This system could generate a dataset of user speech, transcriptions, guessing patterns, and system responses, useful for studying human speech behavior in interactive guessing games. By logging voice input, guessed words, response times, and system decisions, we could analyze engagement and accuracy trends. Adding sensing modalities like facial expression recognition, microphone amplitude for emotion detection, or gesture sensors could capture richer interaction cues to improve future multimodal learning and system adaptability.
